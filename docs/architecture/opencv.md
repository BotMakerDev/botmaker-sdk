# OpenCV / native loading

The native library is `org.openpnp:opencv` (self-contained — bundles the OS native and loads it via
`nu.pattern.OpenCV.loadLocally()`). **All loading goes through shared's single idempotent loader
`com.botmaker.shared.opencv.OpenCvNative.ensureLoaded()`.** It is invoked from a `static {}` block on the
classes that first touch an `org.opencv` type — `ImageTemplate` (which owns the image `Mat`) and shared's
`OpencvManager` — so every find/match path loads the native before any Mat is created, independent of JVM
class-link order. Do not rely on scattered per-class blocks elsewhere; a class that links an OpenCV type
without a guaranteed-loaded path is how "opencv not loaded" errors return. `ImageFinder.find` deliberately
does **not** catch `Error`s (e.g. `UnsatisfiedLinkError`), so a genuine load failure surfaces instead of
masquerading as "not found".

**The matching engines live in shared** (`shared.opencv`: `OpencvManager`, `ColorMatcher`,
`ResolutionScaler`), because an editor matches at edit time exactly as a bot does at run time. They work on
`org.opencv.core.Mat` and return the raw `RawMatch`/`RawColorMatch` records (plain ints + score, no OpenCV
types); **mapping those onto the public `MatchResult`/`ColorMatch` is the SDK's job**, in `api.vision`.
Because shared cannot see `api.geometry.Size`, the matcher takes the authored resolution as a
`java.awt.Dimension`; `ImageTemplate.authoredSize()` is the single conversion point.
