# Android emulator (`internal.emulator`, since 2026-10-01; a bot writes `CaptureSource.emulator(name)`)

The emulator **capability** — the dadb transport (`AdbDevice`) and product discovery (`Platforms`,
`BlueStacks`/`LdPlayer`, `WindowsRegistry`, `EmulatorInstance`) — lives in **shared**
(`com.botmaker.shared.emulator`), because both the SDK (connect at runtime) and the plugin's picker need it.
dadb therefore comes in transitively via shared — it is **not** a direct SDK dependency.

The SDK owns only the facade `internal.emulator`: **`Emulator implements CaptureSource`** (wraps a shared
`AdbDevice`; `origin()` is `(0,0)` so a match's coords are already emulator pixels and the whole vision/click
stack works unchanged; `click(Point)` → `adb input tap`) and **`Emulators`** (static discovery over shared's
`Platforms`: `list`/`first`/`named`/`connect`, plus `use()`/`use(String)` connect-and-set-`Source` shorthands).
