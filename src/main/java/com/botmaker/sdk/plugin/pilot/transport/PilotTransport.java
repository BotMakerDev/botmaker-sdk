 * One way of making the Remote Pilot's server reachable from a phone.
 *
 * <p>The server is the same whatever the transport: it binds {@link #bindHost()}, and the transport then
 * makes that port reachable and says at which address ({@link #open(int)}). A tunnel binds loopback, so only
 * the tunnel reaches the server; a direct transport binds one interface, never all of them. The pairing token
 * is checked on every connection whichever transport carried it.
 *
 * <p>Every method may block (a CLI call, a child process), so none runs on the JavaFX thread. None throws: a
 * failure is a value the pairing dialog can show.
